# Task 1: Student Score Prediction

## Description:
- **Dataset (Recommended):** Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)
- Build a model to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours
- Perform data cleaning and basic visualization to understand the dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a linear regression model to estimate final scores
- Visualize predictions and evaluate model performance

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Covered Topics:
- Regression | Evaluation metrics

## Bonus:
- Try polynomial regression and compare performance
- Try experimenting with different feature combinations (e.g., removing or adding features like sleep, participation, etc.)
